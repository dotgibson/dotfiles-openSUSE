-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Cross-OS system-clipboard provider for Neovim.
--
-- Routes the "+ and "* registers through Core's `clip` / `clip-paste` scripts,
-- which themselves detect WSL / macOS / Wayland / X11. This is what makes
-- `"+y` (yank to system clipboard) and `"+p` (paste from it) work identically on
-- every machine — most importantly on WSL, where Neovim otherwise has NO native
-- clipboard provider and `"+y` silently does nothing.
--
-- Requires `clip` and `clip-paste` on PATH (bootstrap.sh symlinks them into
-- ~/.local/bin). If they're missing, we leave Neovim's own auto-detection alone
-- so nothing breaks on a box that hasn't been bootstrapped.
--
-- NOTE: This is an OPT-IN setup. Yanks/deletes stay in Neovim's own registers
-- by default; you reach the system clipboard explicitly with the "+ register
-- (e.g. "+yy / "+p). That's why options.lua does NOT set clipboard=unnamedplus —
-- the two were contradicting each other before. This keeps `<leader>p`
-- (paste-without-yank) and the black-hole register behaving as intended.

  -- yanks to the system clipboard over the terminal escape sequence, no external helper needed.
