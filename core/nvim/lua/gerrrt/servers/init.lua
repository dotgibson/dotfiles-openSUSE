-- TITLE : LSP server registry
-- ABOUT : Registers every server's config with native vim.lsp.config, then enables the ones whose
--         binary is actually installed. Each gerrrt/servers/<name>.lua returns a PLAIN TABLE — the
--         server's config — and the `servers` list below is the single place a name is written.
--
-- WHY NOT lsp/<name>.lua : Neovim 0.11+ also reads server configs from `lsp/<name>.lua` on the
--         runtimepath, which looks like the tidier home for these. It is a TRAP here. Resolution is
--             tbl_deep_extend("force", config["*"], <every lsp/<name>.lua on rtp>, config[<name>])
--         and the rtp files are merged in rtp ORDER with the user config dir FIRST — so
--         nvim-lspconfig's own lsp/<name>.lua, coming later, would override ours key-for-key.
--         Verified empirically: a user lsp/gopls.lua setting `cmd = { "PROBE_CMD" }` resolved to
--         `cmd = { "gopls" }` — lspconfig won. Explicit vim.lsp.config(name, tbl) calls, as below,
--         are the LAST argument to that merge and therefore always win, which is what we want:
--         lspconfig supplies the sensible defaults, this repo supplies the deliberate overrides.
-- ================================================================================================

-- Client capabilities, advertised ONCE on the "*" wildcard rather than threaded through all 19
-- server modules. Every server config deep-merges over this, so a server needing an extra
-- capability (html/cssls and their snippetSupport) sets only the leaf it cares about.
-- Guarded: if blink.cmp fails to load (fresh box, plugin not built yet) fall back to Neovim's
-- defaults rather than aborting the whole server stack.
local ok, capabilities = pcall(function()
	return require("blink.cmp").get_lsp_capabilities()
end)
if not ok then
	capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
end
vim.lsp.config("*", { capabilities = capabilities })

-- The servers we WANT on. This list is the ONLY place a server name appears: it drives both the
-- module require and the enable pass below. (It used to be written twice — once as a require block,
-- once as a `wanted` table — which was pure drift risk.)
--
-- Python: ty (types) + ruff (lint/codeactions) is the Astral stack — pyright intentionally not
-- enabled. To fall back to pyright, add servers/pyright.lua and list it here.

-- to "that one server is unconfigured" instead of taking the whole LSP stack — and the editor —
-- down with it.

	local okm, cfg = pcall(require, "gerrrt.servers." .. name)
	if okm and type(cfg) == "table" then

-- Only enable a server whose executable is actually installed. Native vim.lsp.enable() otherwise
-- tries to SPAWN the configured cmd every time a matching filetype opens, and a missing binary
-- surfaces as a recurring "spawn <server> ENOENT" / "client quit" error on every such buffer. This
-- guard keeps the stack resilient on any box where a binary isn't present yet (fresh machine,
-- DOTFILES_OFFLINE, or a uv/npm-provided server like ruff/ty/solidity not installed).
--
-- FUNCTION-`cmd` SERVERS : current nvim-lspconfig ships `cmd` as a FUNCTION (a probe that prefers a
-- project-local node_modules/.bin binary) for exactly the npm-provided servers most likely to be
-- missing. Verified against the installed lspconfig on 0.12.4:
--     ts_ls / yamlls / tailwindcss / cssls -> type(cmd) == "function"
--     gopls / lua_ls                       -> type(cmd) == "table"
-- The old `type(cmd) ~= "table" -> return true` branch therefore waved those through unconditionally
-- — they still produced the recurring ENOENT this guard exists to prevent, AND never appeared in the
-- "not enabled" notification, so the user got no signal in either direction.
--
-- WHY THE GLOBAL-BINARY TEST ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH : those launchers look for a PROJECT-LOCAL binary
-- FIRST and only then fall back to the global one, e.g. lspconfig's lsp/ts_ls.lua:
--     local local_cmd = vim.fs.joinpath(config.root_dir, 'node_modules/.bin', cmd)
--     if vim.fn.executable(local_cmd) == 1 then cmd = local_cmd end
-- This enable pass runs BEFORE any client exists, so there is no root_dir to consult — and if we
-- answer "unavailable" the server is never enabled, no client ever starts, and that launcher never
-- runs. A project-local install therefore CANNOT "win at spawn time"; deciding on the global binary
-- alone would break the very common npm layout of no global install + a devDependency.
--
-- So: available if the global binary is on PATH, OR a node_modules/.bin/<binary> is reachable from
-- the cwd. The second test is a heuristic (cwd is not necessarily the root_dir of a file you open
-- later), which is why it is biased to FAIL OPEN — an unnecessary enable costs at most the ENOENT
-- we were already living with, whereas a wrong skip silently removes a working server.
