-- ================================================================================================
-- NOTE: no on_attach is passed to rustaceanvim's server below. Buffer-local LSP keymaps
-- (K, gd, gr, <leader>ca, ...) are applied globally by the LspAttach autocmd in
-- config/autocmds.lua, which fires for rust-analyzer like every other server — so Rust gets
-- the same maps for free. (Passing utils/lsp.on_attach here used to be a no-op: rustaceanvim
-- calls server.on_attach with the classic (client, bufnr) signature, but that function expects
-- an LspAttach *event* table and early-returns on anything else.)
local config = function()
	-- Rust's debug entry point. Since dap.autoload_configurations is off (see the note below), this
	-- is what materialises rust-analyzer's debuggables — it replaces <leader>dc as the way to START
	-- a Rust session; everything after (breakpoints, stepping, scopes) is the normal <leader>d* set
	-- from plugins/nvim-dap.lua.
	--
	-- Bound HERE rather than in a lazy `keys` entry: this spec already loads on `ft = "rust"`, and a
	-- lazy `keys` entry is a LOAD TRIGGER — once the plugin is loaded by a different trigger,
	-- lazy.nvim drops the stub and expects the plugin to own the mapping, which rustaceanvim does
	-- not. Defining it in config means it exists exactly when rustaceanvim is active (verified: the
	-- keys-entry version silently never mapped).
	vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>dR", "<cmd>RustLsp debuggables<cr>", { desc = "Rust debuggables (start)" })

			-- Do NOT materialise Rust debug configurations on LSP attach.
			--
			-- rustaceanvim defaults this to true (config/internal.lua), and on rust-analyzer attach
			-- lsp/init.lua calls add_dap_debuggables(), which `require('dap')`. Under lazy.nvim that
			-- module access AUTOLOADS nvim-dap and its dependency — so merely opening a Rust file
			-- pulled in the whole DAP stack, and the debuggables request can kick off background
			-- `cargo` work to enumerate targets. Measured before this line: opening a .rs file
			-- reported `nvim-dap loaded = true, nvim-dap-python loaded = true`.
			--
			-- That silently contradicted the "loads only on debug keymaps" contract in
			-- plugins/nvim-dap.lua.
			--
			-- TRADEOFF, stated plainly: with autoload off, a bare `<leader>dc` (dap.continue) does
			-- NOT see rust-analyzer's debuggables, because nothing has asked for them yet. Rust
			-- debugging therefore goes through rustaceanvim's own entry points, which load the
			-- configurations on demand — `<leader>dR` below (:RustLsp debuggables) to pick a target,
			-- or :RustLsp debug. Once loaded, the normal dap keymaps (step/breakpoint/scopes) apply
			-- as usual. Prefer the old behaviour? Set this back to true and accept that opening any
			-- .rs file loads the DAP stack and may trigger background cargo work.

				-- otherwise become the adapter command. Final fallback is the bare name so the
				-- failure is a clean "not found" rather than executing garbage.
