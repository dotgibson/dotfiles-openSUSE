-- TITLE : lualine.nvim | statusline (NvChad-styled)
-- LINKS : https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim
-- ABOUT : NvChad's block statusline, rebuilt as a STANDARD lualine config — no NvChad backend,
--         no statusline caching, no managed toggle state. Just lualine's own theming with
--         NvChad's rounded "bubble" separators and section layout:
--           left  : mode (rounded bubble) · git branch · git diff (+~-)
--           center: filename (relative) with modified/readonly markers
--           right : search count · attached LSP servers · diagnostics · filetype · cwd ·
--                   scroll-percentage + location (one rounded bubble)
-- LOOK  : the signature NvChad move is the ROUNDED block — half-circle caps  (U+E0B6) and
--          (U+E0B4) instead of powerline arrows, with NO inner component separators so each
--         half reads as one clean run of blocks. Colors come from a HAND-BUILT theme derived from
--         tokyonight's resolved palette (build_theme below) — not lualine's bundled tokyonight
--         theme — so the blocks map onto NvChad's structure (accent mode/location PILLS at both
--         ends, a lighter git/cwd block, a base filename run) and each section keeps a solid bg,
--         which is what makes the pills read as opaque islands on the transparent bar. Because it
--         pulls from the same palette tokyonight hands `on_highlights` (utils/ui-highlights.lua),
--         it stays theme- and transparency-aware; the tokyonight `style` is resolved once in
--         utils/palette.lua (mirror it in plugins/theme.lua) — both default to "storm".
-- ICONS : All glyphs are written as \u{XXXX} escapes (Nerd Font private-use codepoints),
--         NOT raw glyphs. Raw glyphs get silently stripped when text passes through tools
--         that don't preserve the private-use area; escapes are plain ASCII in the file and
--         decode to the glyph at runtime, so they survive copy/paste/transfer intact.
--         Each escape is named in a trailing comment. Requires a Nerd Font in your terminal.
--         If any single glyph shows as a box (tofu), your font lacks it — swap that codepoint.
--         Diagnostic glyphs are kept IDENTICAL to utils/diagnostics.lua + bufferline so the
--         gutter, tabline and statusline never disagree (this matters more than matching
--         NvChad's exact glyphs — the NvChad look here is the block styling, not the icons).
